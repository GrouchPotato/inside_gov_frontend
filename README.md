inside_gov_frontend
===================

This is a prototype app to demonstrate how the frontend portion of Whitehall could be migrated out.  It is related to [this proposal](https://docs.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/document/d/1kNmP1t9BcZNl2gCAo3s6yRQ63JuiGzu_tjLaYr8GL6g)

It should be looked at alongside [inside_gov_api](https://github.com/GrouchPotato/inside_gov_api)

If for whatever reason you want to get it running, you'll need the following:

* This app, running wherever
* [inside_gov_api](https://github.com/GrouchPotato/inside_gov_api), running at localhost:3201
* [this branch of whitehall](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/tree/add-api-endpoints-for-inside-gov-api), running at localhost:3020

The topic index is the action which has been migrated: `/topics`
